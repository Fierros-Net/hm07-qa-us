# Technologies in use
- JEST: A JavaScript testing framework that provides necessary functionality to write automated tests.
- VS Code: An program used for writing code and running the test scripts.

# Running the Tests in VS Code

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command in the terminal: npm install
4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the tests using the following command: npm test
